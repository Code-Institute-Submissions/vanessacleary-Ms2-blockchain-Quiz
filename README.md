## Project Goals:
  Give players an opportunity to practice their Blockchain knowledge and compete for the highest score. This game contains questions for beginner, intermediate and advanced and the aim of the game is to help players gain knwledge and showcase their Blockchain knowledge. It is suitable for anyone who wants to learn about the blockchain, has minimum knowledge but wants to learn more or for those studying and working with blockchain

## User Expierence: 
### Site goals:
**Site Owners Goals:** 
* As a site owner I want to create an attractive, responsive and easy to use game for the user.
* As a site owner I want the site to work as intended, loading new questions and incrementing the score as the user progresses with a count timer for each question.
* As a site owner I want create game with a varied choice of questions
* As a site owner I want users to be able to save their score
* As a site owner I wants users to navigate easily through different pages of the site

### User Stories:

**First Time Visitor Goals**
* As a first time visitor, I want the game to be attractive and easy to read.
* As a first time visitor, I want the game to be responsive to whichever device I am playing it on.
* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate around the different pages of the site.
* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to learn how the game works.
* As a first time visitor, I want to be given a choice of varied questions.

**Returning Visitor Goals**
* As a returning user, I want to be given varied questions each time I play.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to record my score and try to get on a leaderboard.
* As a returning user, I want to see other users' previous scores so I can try to beat them.

## Design:
* The design of the website was chosen with the topic in mind. It was designed to be visually pleasing for the game players with an easy UX to guide players to the different elements. This was achieved by using 2 block colors with contrasting hover effects. The theme was kept consistent throughout each web page.

### Wireframes

* Balsamiq was used the create the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet.
* The finished website is the same as the original wireframes. 

* The links to each one can be found here:
   * [Desktop](docs/wireframes/Desktop-wireframe.JPG)
   * [Mobile](docs/wireframes/Mobile-wireframe.JPG)
   * [Tablet](docs/wireframes/Tablet-wireframe.JPG)

### Colors

* I created a colour scheme of blue(#56a5eb) and navy(#0b0e1e) which were from the backgroud image. Blue and navy are bold string colors and compliment the blockchain theme. Blue is the branded color for the blockchain.

### Typography 
I chose 'Rubik' from Google Fonts. I chose this font because:
  * The bold weight and sharp edge works well with for the blockchain theme.
  * It's also a sans-serif font which is more accessible for people with dyslexia. Sans-serif is the back-up font if Rubik fails.

### Imagery
* This website has one image as the main background across each page. It is a dark image with blue blockchains. This image was used as it complement the website theme and didnâ€™t detract from the game.

## Features

**Home Page**
* A modal for the user to click to see how to play the game 
* A play button that for the user to start the game
* A highscores page where the user can compete to get on the leaderboard.
* Social media links, the websites creators github and linkedin were chosen to for portfolio purposes

**Game Page**
* A question counter that shows the user which question number they are on out of 10.
* A score counter that increases the users score by 10 for each question they get right.

* A 30 second timer that counts down on screen and resets for each new question and moves to the next question when the answer is chosen.
* A home button that will take the user back to the main page.
* A spinning loader is displayed briefly on screen before the questions are loaded.

## Known Issues and Bugs
* The highscores page only loads the scores of user, users cannot see other players highscores. This was discovered during the testing stage that I carried out with friends.
* There is an issue with the spinning loader being displayed when the game is loading and when there is a delay between moving to the next question. 
* For some questions on dekstop the prgress bar shows a little gap that shows the background color under the top margin, this is something minor that I would like to solve.
